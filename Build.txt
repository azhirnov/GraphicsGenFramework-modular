1. make prjects for externals:
external projects used for pipeline compiler only, if you don't need compiler then skip this step.
source folder: "External/LunarGLASS"	with CMakeLists.txt
binary folder: "build_LunarGLASS"

2. make projects for engine:
source folder: ""	with CMakeLists.txt
binary folder: "build"

3. for MS Visual Studio only
open solution "build/ModularGraphicsFramework.sln" and compile projects.

4. for other compilers
- build external projects.
- use Utils/CMake to update engine cmake file, static libraries from externals will be added.
- or add static libraries to cmake manualy.
- build engine.
